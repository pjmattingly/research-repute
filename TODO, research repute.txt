continue checking through initial research content, queuing up additional reading as I get pointers form the reading
trying to answer the question: what is the state of the art on addressing the problem of trust in information, when you can never completely trust any document?

TODO
    TODO, go through links from Hacker News, to show other people that have spotted this issue

    TODO, go through the existing content and critique; What kind of questions does this raise? What type of research would be helpful to shore up the argument?

    TODO, The pirate community has dealt with this problem, how did they solve it?
        Trust, essentially. They trust some sites, and some people to delivery, because they have shown they are trustworthy over time

    TODO, this is a magnification of the spam problem
        Or: How do you find signal (human authored information whose information is useful to some party)
        in the noise (spam, propaganda, bad actors, advertising, etc)

    TODO, is this a tragedy of the commons?
        Those that see profit in the shared space of the Internet, have every reason to exploit it and little reason to preserve it
        While those that seek to exchange information and make connection do have reason to preserve it

    TODO, items sourced from "Prepare for the Textpocalypse"

        here we see an early example of the spam problem
        "Exactly that scenario already played out on a small scale when, last June, a tweaked version of GPT-J, an open-source model, was patched into the anonymous message board 4chan and posted 15,000 largely toxic messages in 24 hours."

        "William Safire, who was among the first to diagnose the rise of “content” as a unique internet category in the late 1990s, was also perhaps the first to point out that content need bear no relation to truth or accuracy in order to fulfill its basic function, which is simply to exist; or, as Kate Eichhorn has argued in a recent book about content, to circulate."

        "We face, in essence, a crisis of never-ending spam, a debilitating amalgamation of human and machine authorship. From Finn Brunton’s 2013 book, Spam: A Shadow History of the Internet, we learn about existing methods for spreading spurious content on the internet, such as “bifacing” websites which feature pages that are designed for human readers and others that are optimized for the bot crawlers that populate search engines; email messages composed as a pastiche of famous literary works harvested from online corpora such as Project Gutenberg, the better to sneak past filters (“litspam”); whole networks of blogs populated by autonomous content to drive links and traffic (“splogs”); and “algorithmic journalism,” where automated reporting (on topics such as sports scores, the stock-market ticker, and seismic tremors) is put out over the wires. Brunton also details the origins of the botnets that rose to infamy during the 2016 election cycle in the U.S. and Brexit in the U.K."

        "Meanwhile, the editor of a long-running science-fiction journal released data that show a dramatic uptick in spammed submissions beginning late last year, coinciding with ChatGPT’s rollout. (Days later he was forced to close submissions altogether because of the deluge of automated content.)"

    TODO, reading
        I've read this before, but it needs to be noted

        I believe that Hacker News is a system in the wild that implements a proto-form of repute-based discussion and trust
        you get points for posting, and making good comments
        there are no downvotes
        those without a lot of points aren't as visisble

        this article talks about Hacker News developed
        it seems like a logical out growth of Reddit and its drawbacks

        Blockchain Consensus Algorithms

        this article has a sentence that looks very promising:

        ```
        Byzantine problem highlights the troubles of dealing with a system filled with independent and untrustworthy nodes that need to collaborate together and come up with consensus.

        Sounds familiar? (Cough: Blockchain)
        ```

        this may indicate that my earlier intuitions about Blockchain were well founded
        and Blockchain might be a good basis for tracking repute
        where repute can be thought of as "personal capital"

    TODO, Anathem started me off thinking about repute, does it have a reference section so I can find out what inspired Stephenson to talk about it?

        they also talk about the conept of "revokation" in the article
        where it's sometimes need to "revoke" a credential
        or when updating information
            "This has obvious use cases for professional credentials being revoked for fraud or misconduct, and for driver's licenses being revoked for criminal activity."

            "In addition, it seems likely that the data inside credentials will change over time (e.g., a person's mailing address or phone number updates). This is likely to be quite common, revocation can be used to guarantee currency of credential data when it happens. In other words, revocation may be used to force updated data, not just to revoke authorization."

IDEAs
    idea, this is a spam problem, so what's the history of spam?

    idea, I think the issue might be that cost of producing high quality spam has lowered significantly, while at the same time the difficulty of detecting the spam has risen significantly
        so much so that it almost takes an expert to tell the difference between a real document and a spam one

    idea, rather than binary trust, trust should be real-valued
        that is, we're pretty sure we can trust an agent, but we can never be 100% certain
        and there may be value in documents from those with lower repute
        though their content should be held under suspicion
        that is, guilty until proven innocent

    idea, what about game theory?
        is there a theory of trust that is modeled by game theory?
