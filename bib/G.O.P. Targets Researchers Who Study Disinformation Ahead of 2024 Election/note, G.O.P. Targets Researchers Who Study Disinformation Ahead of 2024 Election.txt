"The effort has encumbered its targets with expansive requests for
information and, in some cases, subpoenas — demanding notes,
emails and other information related to social media companies
and the government dating back to 2015. Complying has consumed
time and resources and already affected the groups’ ability to do
research and raise money, according to several people involved."

"Those complaints have been fueled by Twitter’s decision under its
new owner, Elon Musk, to release selected internal
communications between government officials and Twitter
employees. The communications show government officials urging
Twitter to take action against accounts spreading disinformation
but stopping short of ordering them to do, as some critics claimed."

"Twitter, under Mr. Musk, has made a point of lifting restrictions and
restoring accounts that had been suspended, including the
Gateway Pundit’s. YouTube recently announced that it would no
longer ban videos that advanced “false claims that widespread
fraud, errors or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past U.S.
presidential elections.”"
