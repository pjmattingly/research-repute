"A major question that has thus far been almost entirely unexamined is how this AI-dominated future will affect people’s minds."

"There’s been some research into how using AI in their jobs will affect people mentally, but there isn’t yet an understanding of how simply living amongst so much AI-generated content and systems will affect people’s sense of the world. How is AI going to change individuals and society in the not-too-distant future?"

"AI will obviously make it easier to produce disinformation—from fake images to deepfakes to fake news. That will affect people’s sense of trust as they’re scrolling on social media."

    "Larry Rosen, a professor emeritus of psychology at California State University, Dominguez Hills, says he worries that AI will make people more reliant on technology."

a pointer to "Michael Graziano" at Princeton
    "Michael Graziano, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Princeton University, says he thinks AI could create a “post-truth world.” He says it will likely make it significantly easier to convince people of false narratives, which will be disruptive in many ways."

a pointer to Michal Kosinski at Standford
    "Michal Kosinski, a computational psychologist and associate professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, says AI could have an interesting impact on how people think about their work."
