Why is There a Data Trust Deficit?
https://www.acm.org/media-center/2023/june/techbrief-data-trust-deficit
    "“The Data Trust Deficit” is focused on a key challenge: that the full potential of data-driven systems cannot be realized without better understanding the roots of the distrust they can engender."

    "“It’s increasingly difficult to participate in society without using systems that collect your data,” says Helen Kennedy, a Professor at the University of Sheffield and lead author of the new TechBrief. “But while the public is using these systems on a daily basis, people don’t necessarily trust them. The most important goal for the computing field is to ensure that data systems are built from the ground up to be trustworthy. A first step in building trustworthy systems must be to understand why people have these doubts.”"

    " It involves
accepting possible risks, in exchange for the benefits
that trusting brings, and is a prerequisite to taking
action in the future.12"

"These
systems, however, are often used in spite of an
absence of trust in them, because people have no
choice but to use them to access vital services.14"
