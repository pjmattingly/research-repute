"A major misconception about “misinformation” is that it is a literal lack of factual information."

"Thus, a heuristic: Where your factual information outpaces your natural curiosity, you’re probably a crank. For example, I know that geothermal was excluded from section 390 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which may be killing progress on geothermal because new developments must pass strenuous environmental review. I have not hitherto demonstrated curiosity about geothermal energy in general."

strange that they conflate reading with only facts
what about models? argumentation?
    "Now, that’s too pessimistic for me. I doubt we would see the same pattern with topics that aren’t already politically controversial. But, to take a broader view, it’s tempting to have a linear model of intellectual development, in which learning useful facts is consistently good. Subconsciously, I think this is what motivates me to read more books."
