""AI-generated text might be the best of both worlds [for propagandists]", said Shelby Grossman, a scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory at a recent talk."

"Using a large language model that's a predecessor of ChatGPT, researchers at Stanford and Georgetown created fictional stories that swayed American readers' views almost as much as real examples of Russian and Iranian propaganda."

"The Stanford and Georgetown researchers found that with a little human editing, model-generated articles affected reader opinion to a greater extent than the foreign propaganda that seeded the computer model. Their paper is currently under review."

"And catching this, right now, is hard. While there are still some ways to tell AI-generated images, software aimed at detecting machine-generated text - like Open AI's classifier and GPTZero - often fail. Technical solutions like watermarking the text that AI produces has been floated, but none are in place at the moment."
