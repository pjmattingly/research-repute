Helen Kennedy has a google scholar profile
    see:
    https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=BnXUU0gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate

But a search for "THE DATA TRUST DEFICIT" shows nothing associated with them and nothing on scholar
    see:
    https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Data+Trust+Deficit&btnG=

But there is a reference from the ACM that leads to the document
    see:
    https://www.acm.org/media-center/2023/june/techbrief-data-trust-deficit

So Kennedy seems to be the author of this work, and they appear to be a real person
