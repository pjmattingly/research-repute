they claim to be

```
Jason McAffee
Fullstack Software Engineer
```

A quick search shows nothing.

Doing a google image search for their picture, shows nothing.

A search for "Jason McAffee medium full stack", then shows a picture that seems pretty close
    see:

Which redirects to "RocketReach" (?)
    see:
    https://rocketreach.co/jason-mcaffee-email_10157286

Which shows them working at "Sofi"

A search for "Sofi" shows it is a real company
    see:
    https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/social-finance

Taking a look at their site, they don't have a "team" section, so I can't verify if Jason is actually a part of this organization.
    see:
    https://www.sofi.com/

But then a search for "jason mcaffee fullstack sofi" shows a linkedin profile that seems similar
And the search is related to the google image hit we saw before

Then without further leads, a search of linked in for "jason mcaffee"
    see:
    https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?firstName=Jason&lastName=Mcaffee&origin=SEO_PSERP

Which then leads to the actual person
    see:
    https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonmcaffee/

The picture matches.
There's a link to the article I found that seemed to be authored by them.
And the "Experience" section shows them working at Sofi.

So, they seem to be a real person, and have a good amount of experience in software development.

note
    strange that a google search didn't show this as a hit, since the name is an exact match
    and the position at Sofi
    And it shows an article by Medium

    Perhaps LinkedIn restrict google searches somehow?
